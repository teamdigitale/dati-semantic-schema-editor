    Unannotated:
      type: object
      description: >-
        Unannotated objects are rendered normally.
    NoContextNoParty:
      type: object
      x-jsonld-type: https://w3id.org/italia/onto/CPV/Alive
      properties:
        givenName:
          type: string
          description: |-
            Since `x-jsonld-type` is a URI,
            it can be resolved directly on SparQL.

            Even if `x-jsonld-type` is present,
            [JSON-LD Framing](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld-framing/)
            cannot resolve properties because
            there's no `x-jsonld-context`.

            Moreover, the editor warns that to open the playground
            the schema must have a `x-jsonld-context`.
      example:
        givenName: John
    TypeUseContext1:
      type: object
      x-jsonld-type: Person
      x-jsonld-context:
        '@vocab': 'https://w3id.org/italia/onto/CPV/'
      description: |-
        The associated rdf:type is inferred from @vocab.
        The editor shows only the rdf:type information,
        since we have no properties.

        Resulting RDF is:

        ```turtle
        _:b0 a CPV:Person .
        ```
      # Use an empty object to enable the JSON-LD playground.
      example: {}
    TypeUsesContext2:
      type: object
      x-jsonld-type: RPO:RegisteredResidentPerson
      x-jsonld-context:
        '@vocab': 'https://w3id.org/italia/onto/CPV/'
        RPO: https://w3id.org/italia/onto/RPO/
      properties:
        givenName:
          type: string
          description: |-
            The associated rdf:Property is inferred from @vocab.
            The editor shows the retrieved information.
            Resulting RDF is:

            ```turtle
            _:b0 rdf:type RPO:RegisteredResidentPerson .
            _:b0 CPV:givenName "John" .
            ```
      # Use an empty object to enable the JSON-LD playground.
      example:
        givenName: John
    TypeUsesContext3:
      type: object
      x-jsonld-context:
        '@vocab': 'https://w3id.org/italia/onto/CPV/'

        Resolve the rdf:type of the nestest objects using the x-jsonld-context of the parent.

          x-jsonld-type: Person
          description: >-

      description: >-
        The editor warns that to open the playground
        the schema must have an `example`.

        '@base': 'mailto:'
      description: |-
        The email property is used as a resource identifier.

        The RDF is:

        ```turtle

            The editor identifies the controlled vocabulary
            even if it is not mentioned in the context.
